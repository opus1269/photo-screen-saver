# Frequently Asked Questions

* **How do I uninstall this?**

  Right click on the icon in the browser toolbar and select
  "Remove From Chrome..."

  ***

* **Why aren't all my Google Photos albums showing?**

    The API that Google provides to interface with Google Photos does
    not fully support the new shared albums.  To convert an existing
    shared album to a format the screen saver supports,
    select the album, click on 'Sharing Options' and unset the 'Share'
    option.
    
    Also, the extension can only retrieve a maximum of 1000 albums.

* **Why aren't all my photos showing?**

    The extension can only retrieve a maximum of 1000 photos per album.
  
  ***

* **I am signed in to Google Photos, but am getting an error when trying to list of albums. Why is that??**

    You need to sign into the Chrome Browser as the user whose Google 
    Photos you want to use.
    
    You can do this from the Browser's Settings menu.
  
  ***

* **I received a Status: 500 error trying to load my Google Photos albums. What does that mean?**

  This is an error on the Server that provides the photos.
  This is probably a temporary issue - please try again later.

  ***

* **Why do my photos look "squished" or "stretched"?**

  The display mode "Full" will change the aspect ratio of the photo
  to match the screen.  All other modes maintain the photo's aspect
  ratio.

  ***

* **Why is the time label incorrect on my Chromebook?**

  If you have this problem, go to "Settings" -> "Show Advanced Settings" and in
  the "Date and time" section uncheck the "Set time zone automatically using your location".
  You will need to re-start for the change to take effect.

  ***

* **What do the labels on the icon mean?**

  - No label: Screensaver is enabled and will be displayed when the computer is idle.
  - OFF: Screensaver is disabled.  
  - SLP: The time is in the inactive range of the scheduler. The screensaver will not display.
  - PWR: The scheduler will process the Keep Awake settings, but the screensaver will never be displayed.

  ***

* **I have the Keep Awake off, but my display is not sleeping. Why is that?**

  Other applications may be preventing the display or computer from sleeping.

  On many Chrome OS devices the display will not sleep if the screensaver is running.
  You can use the Screensaver/Keep Awake scheduling feature to control when the screensaver is displayed.

  ***

* **I have the Keep Awake on, but my system is shutting down. Why is that?**

  The Keep Awake features are requests to the computer and do not have to be honored.
  The display request is almost always honored, but the system request isn't. In
  particular, many PC's will put the computer to sleep if you have them set to do this.

  ***

* **Can you add support for using files from my local computer?**

  It can be done, but I have not gotten around to it yet.
